{% note tip %}

New {{ ydb-short-name }} clusters are recommended to be deployed using [configuration V2](../configuration-v2/index.md). If a cluster was deployed on [configuration V1](../configuration-v1/index.md), it will continue to be used even after updating to {{ ydb-short-name }} version 25.1 or higher. After such an update, it is recommended to plan and perform [migration to V2](../migration/migration-to-v2.md), as support for V1 will be discontinued in future versions of {{ ydb-short-name }}. You can find out which configuration version is used on the cluster [by following the instructions](../check-config-version.md).
