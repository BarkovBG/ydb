## Unreleased

### Functionality

* 15186:Increased [the query text limit size](../dev/system-views#query-metrics) in system views from 4 KB to 10 KB. [#15186](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/15186) ([spuchin](https://github.com/spuchin))
* 15693:Added a health check configuration that administrators can customize: the number of node restarts, tablets, the time difference between database dynodes,
and timeout (by default, the maximum response time from healthcheck). Documentation is under construction. [#15693](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/15693) ([Andrei Rykov](https://github.com/StekPerepolnen))
* 17394:Added counters to the spilling IO queue to track the number of waiting operations. Documentation is under construction #17599. [#17394](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17394) ([Filitov Mikhail](https://github.com/lll-phill-lll))
* 17362:Add support for [google breakpad](https://chromium.googlesource.com/breakpad/breakpad) inside YDB. Now you can set a minidumps path using an environment variable.
[#17362](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17362) ([Олег](https://github.com/iddqdex))
* 17148:Extended federated query capabilities to support a new external data source [Prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_(software)). Documentation is under construction YQ-4261 [#17148](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17148) ([Stepan](https://github.com/pstpn))
* 17007:Extended federated query capabilities to support a new external data source [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org). Documentation is under construction YQ-4266 [#17007](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17007) ([Slusarenko Igor](https://github.com/buhtr))
* 16076:Added automatic cleanup of temporary tables and directories created during S3 export operations. Previously, users had to manually remove temporary directories and tables that were created as part of the export pipeline. [#16076](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/16076) ([stanislav_shchetinin](https://github.com/stanislav-shchetinin))
* 17682:Last offset and custom message size limit support [#17682](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17682) ([FloatingCrowbar](https://github.com/FloatingCrowbar))
* 17672:Added additional CLI parameters for `ydb debug latency`: --min-inflight allow to specify multiple percentiles using multiple "-p" params [#17672](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17672) ([Evgeniy Ivanov](https://github.com/eivanov89))
* 17650:`Add` operation allows building aggregation queries. For instance, constucting Roaring bitmap from intermediate `AGG_LIST` may be replaced with custom `UDAF` using `Add`, which may be more space efficient `IsEmpty` just nice operation to have, allows skip costly check for cardinality equals to zero [#17650](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17650) ([jsjant](https://github.com/jsjant))
* 17618:Don't allow SelfHeal actor to create more than 1 active ReassignerActor. This change will prevent SelfHeal from overloading BSC with ReassignItem requests thus causing DoS. [#17618](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17618) ([Sergey Belyakov](https://github.com/serbel324))
* 17561:Added support for traceparent and updated gRPC client and request settings in the C++ SDK. [#17561](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17561) ([Zarina Tlupova](https://github.com/zarinatlupova))
* 17537:The language version may affect the computation layer, so it should be passed via dq task [#17537](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17537) ([Vitaly Stoyan](https://github.com/vitstn))
* 17360:Add a setting that specifies the initial stream offset by timestamp or duration [#17360](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17360) ([Alexey Pozdniakov](https://github.com/APozdniakov))
* 17324:Support for reading data from Yandex Monitoring [#17324](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17324) ([Ivan Sukhov](https://github.com/evanevanevanevannnn))
* 17314:* Added progress stats period into execute script request API (periodic statistics updates). Added dynamic updates for query service config [#17314](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17314) ([Pisarenko Grigoriy](https://github.com/GrigoriyPA))
* 16932:Add `MaxFaultyPDisksPerNode` to CMS config, so that Sentinel could not exceed that number. This may be useful in case if a node with a large count of disks goes down but it is known that this node will be brought back in the near future. This way, we will not be moving many disks at once (which can be rather long in case of HDDs). If `MaxFaultyPDisksPerNode` is 0, then there is no limit. [#16932](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/16932) ([Semyon Danilov](https://github.com/SammyVimes))
* 17911:Add the list of dependent scheme objects (external tables, column tables) to the description of an external data source. [#17911](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17911) ([Daniil Demin](https://github.com/jepett0))
* 17798:Export/import encryption features in YDB SDK [#17798](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17798) ([Vasily Gerasimov](https://github.com/UgnineSirdis))
* 17711:Add arguments `--breakpad-minidumps-path` and `--breakpad-minidumps-script` to `ydbd server` command for initialize minidumps instead environment. [#17711](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17711) ([Олег](https://github.com/iddqdex))
* 17695:YDB FQ: pushdown `LIKE` expression [#17695](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17695) ([Vitaly Isaev](https://github.com/vitalyisaev2))
* 17420:Add data erasure request for PQ tablets [#17420](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17420) ([Andrey Molotkov](https://github.com/molotkov-and))
* 18081:Added progress stats to `ydb workload query` with one thread. [#18081](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/18081) ([Nikolay Shumkov](https://github.com/shnikd))
* 17965:Add ability to enable followers (read replicas) for secondary indexes [#17965](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17965) ([Stanislav](https://github.com/raydzast))
* 17920:Add new PDisk status to BSC, which allows to reassign VDisks from PDisk via SelfHeal without considering VDisk erroneous. Intended to be used instead of FAULTY status when node is taken to long term maintenance. [#17920](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17920) ([Sergey Belyakov](https://github.com/serbel324))
* 17864:Фdded file name and line number to logs [#17864](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17864) ([Vladislav Stepanyuk](https://github.com/vladstepanyuk))
* 17687:To avoid ambiguity, we switched to using the PDisk State from BSC info to determine the PDisk status instead of the PDisk status in CMS. It is already used in the healthcheck fallback logic and reflects the actual disk condition. We plan to make it the primary source for PDisk state in healthcheck. [#17687](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17687) ([Andrei Rykov](https://github.com/StekPerepolnen))
* 16491:Added hidden option `--progress` to `ydb sql` command with default: "none", that print progress of query execution. [#16491](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/16491) ([Nikolay Shumkov](https://github.com/shnikd))

* 16061:Fixed a bug in handling OLAP scan queries with predicates. [#16061](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/16061) ([Semyon](https://github.com/swalrus1))
* 16060:Fixed an [error](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/issues/15551) that caused the **RETURNING** clause  work incorrectly with INSERT/UPSERT operations. [#16060](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/16060) ([Vitalii Gridnev](https://github.com/gridnevvvit))
* 16021:Fixed a rare error that led to a VERIFY error when replicating data. #10650 [#16021](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/16021) ([Alexander Rutkovsky](https://github.com/alexvru))
* 16016:Fixed rare node failures during read session balancing. https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/issues/16017 [#16016](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/16016) ([Nikolay Shestakov](https://github.com/nshestakov))
* 16423:Changed behavior — `SHOW CREATE TABLE` now fails on views instead of producing wrong output. [#16423](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/16423) ([Daniil Demin](https://github.com/jepett0))
* 16768:Fixed an issue with topic auto-partitioning when the `max_active_partition` configuration parameter was set via the `ALTER TOPIC` statement. [#16768](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/16768) ([Nikolay Shestakov](https://github.com/nshestakov))
* 16764:Fixed redirects from cluster endpoints (storage nodes) to database nodes, resolving inconsistent behavior where some system tables were not visible. #16763 [#16764](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/16764) ([Alexey Efimov](https://github.com/adameat))
* 17198:Fixed an issue with UUID data type handling in YDB CLI backup/restore operations. [#17198](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17198) ([Semyon Danilov](https://github.com/SammyVimes))
* 17157:Viewer API: Fixed the retrieval of tablet list for tables implementing secondary indexes. #17103 [#17157](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17157) ([Alexey Efimov](https://github.com/adameat))
* 17606:healthcheck: fix check for unknown StatusV2 in VDisks (https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/issues/17619) А forward compatibility issue fix [#17606](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17606) ([Andrei Rykov](https://github.com/StekPerepolnen))
* 17556:Fix S3 export multipart upload: EntityTooSmall error
https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/issues/16873 [#17556](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17556) ([Vasily Gerasimov](https://github.com/UgnineSirdis))
* 17497:The SDK user writes messages to the topic in a transaction. It does not wait for confirmation that the messages have been recorded and calls Commit. The processing of this and the following transactions in the PQ tablet stops. When processing the `UserActionAndTransactionEvents` queue, it was not taken into account that the `TEvGetWriteInfoError` message was received. As a result, the transaction remained at the head of the queue and blocked the processing of other operations. [#17497](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17497) ([Alek5andr-Kotov](https://github.com/Alek5andr-Kotov))
* 17468:fix output of optional structs, closes #17226 [#17468](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17468) ([Alexey Efimov](https://github.com/adameat))
* 17429:https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/issues/16176 [#17429](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17429) ([Nikolay Shestakov](https://github.com/nshestakov))
* 17418:Previously replication didn't handle StatusFlags from PDisk properly and didn't stop when available space was running low. Because of this, space was consumed until VDisk and corresponding storage group became read-only. With this change, replication will postpone on YELLOW_STOP color flag and resume after a certain delay if enough space is available. [#17418](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17418) ([Sergey Belyakov](https://github.com/serbel324))
* 16208:YQ-4205 fixed query service config passing into SS [#16208](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/16208) ([Pisarenko Grigoriy](https://github.com/GrigoriyPA))
* 17872:Missed #ifdef has been added. MSG_ZEROCOPY related code works only on linux. [#17872](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17872) ([Daniil Cherednik](https://github.com/dcherednik))
* 17842:The transaction has entered the EXECUTED state, but has not yet saved it to disk. If the tablet receives a TEvReadSet, it will send a TEvReadSetAck in response. TEvReadSetAck and it will delete the transaction. If the tablet restarts at this point, the transaction will remain in the WAIT_RS state. The tablet should send TEvReadSetAck only after it saves the transaction status to disk. [#17842](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17842) ([Alek5andr-Kotov](https://github.com/Alek5andr-Kotov))
* 17826:TGuardActor should be launched only in case of uncompleted ZC transfers. [#17826](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17826) ([Daniil Cherednik](https://github.com/dcherednik))
* 17809:Check row count change in the main thread https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/issues/16949 [#17809](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17809) ([Alexander Avdonkin](https://github.com/aavdonkin))
* 17780:Make PDisk handle `TEvYardControl::PDiskStop` in Error and Init states [#17780](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17780) ([Semyon Danilov](https://github.com/SammyVimes))
* 17743:Filters are more comprehensively pushed into column shards now, mostly using scalar kernels. Once we have all the scalar kernels working, we'll start adding block kernels for special cases [#17743](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17743) ([Pavel Velikhov](https://github.com/pavelvelikhov))
* 18121:`ALTER TABLE table ` should not fail for a table with vector index. [#18121](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/18121) ([azevaykin](https://github.com/azevaykin))
* 18088:Don't allow observing inconsistent results in some read-write transactions. Fixes #18064. [#18088](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/18088) ([Aleksei Borzenkov](https://github.com/snaury))
* 18079: This PR fixes optimisation in `NKikimr::NRawSocket::TBufferedWriter`, that wrote the entire message directly to socket if message was larger than available space in buffer. When we wrote more than 6mb to socket with SSL enabled, it every time returned -11 (WAGAIN). As a quick fix, we replace sending of an entire message to socket with cutting this message into 1mb chunks and sending them to socket one by one. [#18079](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/18079) ([Andrey Serebryanskiy](https://github.com/a-serebryanskiy))
* 18072:The metric value is reset to zero when the `TEvPQ::TEvPartitionCounters` event arrives. Added a re-calculation of the values. [#18072](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/18072) ([Alek5andr-Kotov](https://github.com/Alek5andr-Kotov))
* 18062:fixing crash in /viewer/storage handler, closes https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/issues/17813 [#18062](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/18062) ([Alexey Efimov](https://github.com/adameat))
* 18059:Fix crashes by some SELECT queries with DESC in OLAP tables [#18059](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/18059) ([Semyon](https://github.com/swalrus1))
* 17982:`ALTER TABLE table RENAME INDEX` should not fail for a vector index. [#17982](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17982) ([azevaykin](https://github.com/azevaykin))
* 17913:The PQ tablet forgets about the transaction only after it receives a TEvReadSetAck from all participants. Another shard may be deleted before the PQ completes the transaction (for example, due to a split table). As a result, transactions are executed, but remain in the WAIT_RS_ACKS state. If the PQ tablet sends a TEvReadSet to a tablet that has already been deleted, it receives a TEvClientConnected with the `Dead` flag in response. In this case, we consider that we have received a TEvReadSetAck. [#17913](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17913) ([Alek5andr-Kotov](https://github.com/Alek5andr-Kotov))
* 17836:Fix segfault that could happen while retrying Whiteboard requests https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/issues/18145 [#17836](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17836) ([Andrei Rykov](https://github.com/StekPerepolnen))
* 17830:Fix a bug in writing chunk metadata that makes older versions incompatible with 24-4-analytics. #17791 [#17830](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17830) ([Semyon](https://github.com/swalrus1))
* 17814:Fix BuildIndex/Export/Import operation listing order (#17817) [#17814](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17814) ([Vitaliy Filippov](https://github.com/vitalif))
* 17729:Fix schema version collisions in serverless DBs. #17184 [#17729](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17729) ([Semyon](https://github.com/swalrus1))

### YDB UI

### Performance

* 17725:Limit internal inflight config updates. [#17725](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17725) ([Ilnaz Nizametdinov](https://github.com/CyberROFL))
* 17611:Introduce Intersect boolean operation to avoid actual intersection and checking cardinality after [#17611](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17611) ([jsjant](https://github.com/jsjant))
* 17533:Constant folding now also handles deterministic UDFs. Non-deterministic UDFs are detected via a black list [#17533](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17533) ([Pavel Velikhov](https://github.com/pavelvelikhov))
* 17794:Allow multi broadcast in table service by default. [#17794](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17794) ([Олег](https://github.com/iddqdex))
* 17884:A lot more types of filters are currently getting pushed into column shards, improving performance [#17884](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17884) ([Pavel Velikhov](https://github.com/pavelvelikhov))
