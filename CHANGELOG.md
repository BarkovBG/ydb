### Bug fixes

* Fixed an rare issue that caused client applications to hang during commit operations. The problem occurred because the `TEvDeletePartition` message could arrive before the `TEvApproveWriteQuota` message. The batch did not send TEvConsumed and this blocked the queue of write quota requests.
