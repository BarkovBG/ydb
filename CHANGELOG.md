* 16423:Changed behavior â€” `SHOW CREATE TABLE` now fails on views instead of producing wrong output. [#16423](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/16423) ([Daniil Demin](https://github.com/jepett0))
* 16837:There was a problem with git->arc and arc->git syncs. Because logger in dq_tasks_runner (merged in git) was incompatible with comp nodes logging (merged in arc). When logging is turned off, the logger should be nullptr. But initially it was done so that the logger would not be nullptr, but the logging function inside the logger was empty. Which led to std::bad_function_call exception during the sync.
